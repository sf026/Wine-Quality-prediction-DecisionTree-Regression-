# Wine-Quality-prediction-DecisionTree-Regression-

This project predicts the **quality of wine** based on its chemical properties.  
A **Decision Tree Regressor** is used to model and estimate the wine quality score.

---

## Objective
To build a machine learning model that learns patterns from wine chemical composition and predicts the quality rating given by sensory evaluation.

---

## Dataset Overview
The Wine Quality dataset includes the following features:

- Fixed Acidity  
- Volatile Acidity  
- Citric Acid  
- Residual Sugar  
- Chlorides  
- Free Sulfur Dioxide  
- Total Sulfur Dioxide  
- Density  
- pH  
- Sulphates  
- Alcohol  
- **Quality (Target variable)**

---

##  Model Used
- **Decision Tree Regression**

This algorithm was chosen due to its:
- Easy interpretability  
- Ability to handle non-linear relationships  
- No need for feature scaling

---

##  Workflow
1. Imported the dataset  
2. Checked data structure and summary  
3. Performed exploratory data analysis (heatmaps, correlations, histograms)  
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
5. Trained the **Decision Tree Regressor**  
6. Evaluated model performance using:
   - R² Score
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
